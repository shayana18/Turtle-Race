# Turtle-Race-
In this project I constructed a game similar to crossy roads road. The logic of the game is to pass all five 
levels without being hit by the coloured rectangles (cars). After the turtle reaches the opposite side 
without being hit, the level increases, thus number of cars and car speed increases. If the user is hit by a 
car the game is over, if the user finishes all five levels they win. The turtle is moved forward through the 
up key, this functionality was created using the python turtle class and its listen and onkeypress 
methods. Other aspects of the game such as the car hitting the turtle are created using the turtle 
module as well, using the distance method. This project was my first project using OOP
